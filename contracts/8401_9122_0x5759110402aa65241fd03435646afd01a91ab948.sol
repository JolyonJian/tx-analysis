 * @title The ERC721 contract for the Fuzzy Felons collection.
 *
 * This collection will allow up to MAX_SUPPLY tokens to be minted.
 *
 * The mint price per token is MINT_PRICE.
 * 
 * During its lifetime this contract will go through several phases:
 *   - Phase 0 - Minting is still not active.
 *   - Phase 1 - Whitelisted addresses can mint 1 token each.
 *   - Phase 2 - Whitelisted addresses can mint up to MAX_WL_MINT tokens each,
 *               including any single token minted in Phase 1.
 *   - Phase 3 - Public minting, any address (even if not on whitelist) can mint
 *               up to MAX_PUBLIC_MINT tokens each, including any tokens minted
 *               in Phases 1 and 2.
 *   - Phase 4 - Minting is over. This will monstly happen after MAX_SUPPLY
 *               tokens have been minted or the deadline for Phase 3 is over.
 *
 *  Each of these phases will have a deadline, after which the owner of this
 *  contract will use setPhase() to move on to the next one. See the FAQ at
 *  the website for more info on these phases and deadlines:
 *     https://fuzzyfelons.com/#faq
 *
 * For sake of transparencey, as an assurance that the content of the
 * animations/images will not be tampered unnoticeably by the team, a
 * PROVENANCE hash is published here. This contains the SHA256 hash of all
 * SHA256 hashes of the animation files put together in order of tokenId.
 * Anyone can download all these files, run a SHA256 hash on each one of them,
 * concatenate all the bytes of these hashes and calculate its SHA256 hash to
 * verify that they have the expected content. Thus, the content of these images
 * will forever be recorded and verifiable in the blockchain.
 *
 * The owners of this contract reserve themselves the ability to mint up to
 * MAX_OWNER_MINT tokens for free (except gas). These tokens will be mintable
 * only when the wider public can also mint (Phase 1 to Phase 3). For the sake
 * of transparency and openness this reduces the hipothetical scenario in which
 * the team cherry-picks specific tokens. These tokens are meant to be handed
 * out back to the community and people who supported the team as gifts,
 * raffles, prizes, rewards, etc. The owner specifies which account will
 * receive the newly minted tokens.
 *
 * The owner account is able to withdraw the eth funds from minting in this
 * smart contract into a specified account.
 *
 * The whitelisting process uses a merkle tree and merkle proofs in order
 * to reduce the gas needs for checking if an address is in the whitelist.
 *
 * The contract can be paused at any moment by the team if need be. This will
 * pause the minting and token transfers.
