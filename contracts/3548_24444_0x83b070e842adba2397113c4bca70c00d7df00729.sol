/** @title BLVCK NFT Contract
 * @author Dr. Siniša
 * @notice This contract follows ERC721 standard. It's extended with OpenZeppelin's 'Ownable' library
 * which controls what methods can be called exclusively by contract's owner and eventually allows the current owner
 * to transfer ownership to someone else. see https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/access-control for details.
 * It also includes 'PaymentSplitter' functions which enables the shareholders to withdraw funds from this contract,
 * also including any tokens received. see https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/payment for more.
 * Token IDs are always ordered from 0 to totalSupply(). No 'gaps' and no 'Burned' tokens are possible.
 *   The contract Owner can enable and disable Public Sale which, when enabled, allows tokens to be minted by
 * everyone if the right amount of funds is provided to 'safeMint' method.
 * Price for minting a token can be changed at any time by the Owner, but there is only one price for all tokens
 * at a time. Server base url can be changed if someday maybe NFT metadata will migrate to IPFS or another server/domain.
 *    An address can be assigned by Owner to be 'minter'. That account would normally be controlled
 * by backend to allow more control over minting process, whitelisting, raffle, and would make significant reduction
 * in gas costs. When a user is added to whitelist by raffle or operators, he can then deposit funds to this
 * contract and then wait to be verified by minter service, which will eventually mint NFT(s) to user. Each user has
 * total deposit value stored in this contract, and after received a certain amount of NFTs, that value resets to zero.
